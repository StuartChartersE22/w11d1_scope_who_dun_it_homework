# Scope Homework: Who Dunnit

### Learning Objectives

- Understand function scope
- Know the difference in between the let and const keywords

## Brief

Using your knowledge about scope and variable declarations in JavaScript, look at the following code snippets and predict what the output or error will be and why.

### MVP

#### Episode 1

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Library',
  weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

guess: will return Miss Scarlet as they are all on the same level so the scenario can be seen within the declare Murderer function

Answer: 'The murderer is Miss Scarlet.'
Correct

#### Episode 2

```js
const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

Guess: Error as the murderer has been declared a constant so can't be changed by changeMurderer.

Answer: 'TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.'
Correct

#### Episode 3

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);
```
Guess: first verdict Mrs. Peacock, second Prof. Plum as the murderer is a let so can be changed. The change is then made as a let so can't be seen above the block.

Answer: 'First Verdict:  The murderer is Mrs. Peacock.
Second Verdict:  The murderer is Professor Plum.'
Correct

#### Episode 4

```js
let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);
```
Guess: suspects will return: Miss Scarlet, Prof. Plum, Col. Mustard; but suspect three in the log will be Mrs. Peacock as the reassign is a let inside the function

Answer: 'The suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard.
Suspect three is Mrs. Peacock.'
Correct

#### Episode 5

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
}

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```
Guess: The weapon will be revolver as the scenario is a constant but isn't being reassigned, rather an attribute of the constant is being changed

Answer: 'The weapon is the Revolver.'
Correct

#### Episode 6

```js
let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function () {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
Guess: The declare will be Mrs. White as the let can travel down through the functions.

Answer: 'The murderer is Mrs. White.'
Correct

#### Episode 7

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

    const unexpectedOutcome = function() {
      murderer = 'Miss Scarlet';
    }

    unexpectedOutcome();
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
Guess: The declare will be Miss. Scarlet as the plotTwist defines the murderer as a let so can't be passed up from the function but the unexpectedOutcome simply redefines so can be accessed as the initial define was at the top level.

Answer: 'The murderer is Mr. Green.'
Incorrect: The unexpectedOutcome is within the plotTwist so changes the murderer defined within there but the same reason before stands so the change can't be seen above so only the first change is seen.

#### Episode 8

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Mrs. Peacock',
  room: 'Conservatory',
  weapon: 'Lead Pipe'
};

const changeScenario = function() {
  scenario.murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  scenario.room = 'Dining Room';

  const plotTwist = function(room) {
    if (scenario.room === room) {
      scenario.murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';
    }

    const unexpectedOutcome = function(murderer) {
      if (scenario.murderer === murderer) {
        scenario.weapon = 'Candle Stick';
      }
    }

    unexpectedOutcome('Colonel Mustard');
  }

  plotTwist('Dining Room');
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```
Guess: the weapon will be candle stick as the room can be changed to dining room as in 5, then it is equal to dining room when plotTwist is called so the murderer is changed to Col. Mustard, then the murderer is equal to Col. Mustard when unexpectedOutcome is called so the weapon is changed to candle stick.

Answer: 'The weapon is Candle Stick.'
Correct

#### Episode 9

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
